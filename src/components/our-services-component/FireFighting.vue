      <p>Some of our advanced designed fire detection and suppression technology includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><h4>Passive Fire Products</h4>
          <p>Fire can occur almost anywhere in any kind of facility, but the key to minimising the risk is to prevent fires starting in the first place, and stop them spreading if they do. Combining fire doors and frames with passive fire solutions, such as fire rated glazing systems and fire rated ceilings, helps minimise the spread of harmful flames, hot gases and smoke throughout your facility. For more information please visit our Passive Fire Products section.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Portable Fire Equipment</h4>
          <p>Having serviced and functional fire equipment on hand when and where you need it can mean the difference between a minor blaze and a devastating full scale fire. From portable fire extinguishers to fire proof safes, Gielle offers a comprehensive range of top quality fire equipment that gives you a powerful first line of defence against fire. For more information please visit our Fire Extinguishers, Hose Reels & Cabinets, Fire Blankets, Safes & Fire Resistant Cabinets sections.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Alarms and Evacuation Systems</h4>
          <p>Our fire detection systems provide very early detection of even slow smouldering fires and can be configured to detect carbon monoxide (CO), smoke and heat. Sensitive analytic tools mean early detection that is critical in a residential environment. For more information please visit our Alarm and Evacuation section.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Fire Sprinkler Systems</h4>
          <p>Sprinkler systems can automatically detect a fire, transmit an alarm and control the fire. This can be the difference between a minor accident and a major business shutdown. Led by professional project managers, Gielle’s engineers design, install and commission reliable, cost-effective sprinkler systems by carefully analysing your facility or site in terms of occupancy, operation and fire risk.
