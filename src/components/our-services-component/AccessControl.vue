       my-4  <h4>What are they?</h4>
        <p>Access control systems are simply electronic systems that are designed to grant access to only authorized persons into a place.</p>
        <p>The purpose of access control is to grant entrance to a building or office only to those who are authorized to be there. The deadbolt lock, along with its matching brass key, was the gold standard of access control for many years; however, modern businesses want more. Yes, they want to control who passes through their doors, but they also want a way to monitor and manage access. Keys have now passed the baton to computer-based electronic access control systems that provide quick, convenient access to authorized persons while denying access to unauthorized ones.</p>
        <p>Today, instead of keys, we carry access cards or ID badges to gain entry to secured areas. Access control systems can also be used to restrict access to workstations, file rooms housing sensitive data, printers, as well as entry doors. In larger buildings, exterior door access is usually managed by a landlord, or management agency, while interior office door access is controlled by the tenant company.</p>
        <p>Areas or organizations which require high security use different types of access control systems like bio metric, RFID, door controllers and card readers etc. Each access point may be controlled individually as per the requirement of company or organizations where high security is necessary. Network security is also important, especially in a company which handles sensitive data.</p>
        <h4>Why Access Control?</h4>
        <p>Beyond the obvious reason, physical security, there are several reasons a business or medical facility might need an access control system.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>COMPLIANCE
            <p>Hospitals, doctors’ offices, and health insurance companies need to comply with HIPAA health data regulations. Banks, insurance companies, and any business that accepts and processes credit cards is subject to PCI credit card data regulations. SaaS providers, data centers, or any company hoping to maintain SOC2 cybersecurity standards.</p>
          </li>
          <li>IP DATA
            <p>Businesses that deal with privileged data and intellectual property, such as software developers, entrepreneurs, startups, and pharmaceutical companies need to not only control who comes into their facilities, but which areas they are allowed to access.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>DILIGENT PLOUTOS</strong> provides you with every form of <strong>access control security system</strong>, putting to consideration the foolowing factors:</p>
        <ul class="text-left">
          <li>Application Needs</li>
            <p>The first step is to evaluate the need for access control. Where will the system be installed and what level of security is required for that area. Who will need access and during what hours? The application will determine the features required.</p>
            <p>Consider entry doors, storage, or IT rooms, along with desks, file cabinets, or other doors and drawers holding secure information, valuable assets, or expensive systems. Sensitive information might include client, company, or vendor data and assets.</p>
          <li>Security Needs</li>
            <p>What level of security does the area require? Will single authorization suffice or does security concerns require multi-factor authorization? How many users will need credentials? What level of monitoring will maintain security?</p>
          <li>Compliance and Regulatory Requirements</li>
            <p>What regulatory arms monitor the security measures the company chooses? Does meeting compliance requirements include regular reports? What policies and procedures must coordinate with the security measures implemented?</p>
          <li>Installation Requirements</li>
            <p>How will the company install the system? Will the new system integrate with existing security protocols or operate as a standalone access control system? Will management use in-house staff to install the system or is professional installation needed? How many locks will the control panel operate? What are the company’s software integration needs? Is the system compatible with third-party hardware?</p>
          <li>Compatibility with Existing Security</li>
            <p>Can the system integrate new protocols with the current system. New systems may require all new locking devices or could utilize the existing hardware. Is the new system compatible with other security components such as surveillance cameras?</p>
          <li>Communication</li>
            <p>How will the new system communicate with existing technology within the company? How will user key cards communicate with the reader to verify credentials? What type of authentication will the system support?</p>
          <li>Expandability</li>
            <p>Will the system grow with the company? Can it expand and upgrade as the company grows and technology changes?</p>
          <li>Ease of Use</li>
            <p>How easy is it for managers or administrators to configure and maintain the software? Can they overcome technical issues, cancel, and reissue entrance credentials, and monitor the activity in the secure area? Also consider the ease of use for everyday users, which could include individuals, employees, subcontractors, or customers. The user experience will factor into the effectiveness of the security system. Security measures users find it difficult to maneuver can encourage shortcuts and actions taken to bypass protocols, which can compromise the system.</p>
          <li>Customer Support</li>
            <p>Choose a company which offers a professional level of customer support during the sales, installation, and implementation phase. The company should also have a customer service team in place to assist management with questions or troubleshooting during the operation of the system.</p>
          <li>Cost</li>
            <p>Cost how much will the access control system cost to purchase, install, and maintain over the next decade.</p>
